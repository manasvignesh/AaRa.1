ISSUE 1️⃣ — PROFILE CHANGE NOT REFLECTING IN DASHBOARD (CRITICAL)
Problem

User changes number of meals (or profile configuration) in Profile

Profile updates successfully

Dashboard does NOT reflect the updated value

Requires reload / re-login / navigation to update

This indicates:
❌ Profile state and dashboard state are not bound to the same source of truth

REQUIRED FIX — PROFILE → DASHBOARD SYNC (MANDATORY)
✅ A. SINGLE USER CONFIG STATE

All user configuration values (including):

meals per day

lifestyle

preferences

Must live in ONE shared global user profile state.

❌ Dashboard must NOT cache these values
❌ Dashboard must NOT calculate independently

✅ B. REAL-TIME PROFILE UPDATE PROPAGATION

When a user updates profile settings:

Flow MUST be:

Profile update confirmed

Global user state updated

Dashboard re-renders automatically

If change affects meals:

Regenerate entire day safely

Explain calmly to user

❌ No manual refresh
❌ No delayed sync

✅ C. MEAL COUNT CHANGE RULE (IMPORTANT)

If user changes meals per day in profile:

Apply change only at day boundary OR

Regenerate the full day immediately with explanation

Example UX:

“Your meal structure has been updated.
Today’s meals have been adjusted safely.”

❌ Partial updates are forbidden

ISSUE 2️⃣ — PROGRESS COLUMN UI CAN BE IMPROVED
Problem

Progress section feels cluttered / unclear

Does not visually communicate trends well

Users may not intuitively understand progress at a glance

This is a UI clarity issue, not logic.

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENT — PROGRESS UI (NON-LOGIC)
✅ A. CLEAR VISUAL HIERARCHY

Progress section should:

Show one primary metric (trend)

Secondary metrics visually lighter

No information overload

Example structure:

Big trend graph (daily / weekly / monthly toggle)

Small cards below:

consistency

protein protection

movement

✅ B. CALM DESIGN LANGUAGE

Progress UI must:

Avoid red/green judgment

Use soft gradients or neutral tones

Emphasize trends, not daily spikes

❌ No streak pressure
❌ No “failed / succeeded” language

✅ C. NO LOGIC CHANGE REQUIRED

This task is visual improvement only.

❌ Do NOT change progress calculations
❌ Do NOT add new metrics
❌ Do NOT introduce gamification

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)

☑ Profile changes reflect instantly in dashboard
☑ Meals per day update correctly and safely
☑ Dashboard never shows stale profile data
☑ Progress section is visually clearer
☑ No logic regressions introduced
