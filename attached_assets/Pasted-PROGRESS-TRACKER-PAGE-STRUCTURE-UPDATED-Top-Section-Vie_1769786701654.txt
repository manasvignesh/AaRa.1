PROGRESS TRACKER PAGE — STRUCTURE (UPDATED)
🔹 Top Section — View Selector (MANDATORY)

Provide a clear toggle:

Daily

Weekly

Monthly

Default view:

Weekly (not Daily)

Daily data must exist, but Weekly view is the interpretation default.

📊 DAILY VIEW (RAW BUT EXPLAINED)
Purpose

Show what happened today, without judgment.

What to show

• Daily weight entry
• Meal adherence for the day
• Protein protection status
• Movement done (Yes / No)

Graph Rules

• Line or dot graph
• No red/green judgment colors
• No “up/down = good/bad” indicators

Mandatory Explanation Text (always visible)

“Daily changes are normal.
Water, salt, sleep, and stress affect this.
We use trends — not single days — to guide decisions.”

❌ Do NOT show:

“You gained X today”

“You failed today”

Any alert tied to a single day

📈 WEEKLY VIEW (PRIMARY INTERPRETATION)
Purpose

This is the main decision-making view.

What to show

• Weekly average weight
• Weekly meal adherence summary
• Weekly protein consistency
• Weekly movement consistency

Graph Rules

• Smoothed line
• Fewer points (one per week)
• Calm color palette

System Interpretation (TEXT, NOT NUMBERS)

Examples:

“Fat loss trend is steady.”
“Progress is stable this week.”
“Recovery is being prioritized.”

❌ Do NOT:

Demand action

Push restriction

Highlight “bad weeks”

📉 MONTHLY VIEW (BIG PICTURE)
Purpose

Reinforce patience and long-term consistency.

What to show

• Monthly weight trend
• Consistency overview (meals + movement)

Graph Rules

• Very smooth trend line
• No daily detail
• No sharp labels

Interpretation Text

“Long-term progress matters more than short-term changes.”

This view should reduce anxiety, not increase it.

🔁 BACKEND LOGIC — HOW DATA IS USED
Data Storage

• Store daily entries as-is
• Do NOT discard daily data

Interpretation Rules

• Daily data = informational only
• Weekly data = adaptive decisions
• Monthly data = reassurance + reflection

❗ Safety adjustments must NEVER be triggered by:

a single day

a single spike or drop

⚠️ SAFETY GUARDRAILS (VERY IMPORTANT)
When daily values look concerning:

Do NOT alert immediately

Wait for trend confirmation

Example safe messaging:

“Single-day changes don’t indicate fat gain or loss.”

Rapid Drops / Risk Patterns

If detected across multiple days:

Trigger safety override

Adjust calories / recovery

Explain calmly

🧭 NAVIGATION & STATE SAFETY

• Progress Tracker page must ALWAYS load safely
• If no data exists:

show an empty graph with explanation

never a blank page

Example empty-state text:

“Once you log daily progress, you’ll see your trends here.”

❌ HARD BANS (STILL APPLY)

Even with daily graphs, you must NOT:

❌ Rank days as good/bad
❌ Use streak pressure
❌ Show calorie burn vs eat comparisons
❌ Push “make up for yesterday” logic

Daily data ≠ Daily judgment.

✅ FINAL ASSERTION (IMPORTANT)

This Progress Tracker must communicate:

“Every day counts — but no single day defines you.”

If the system cannot interpret data safely:

👉 Show the data
👉 Reduce commentary
👉 Wait for trends

Never panic the user.
